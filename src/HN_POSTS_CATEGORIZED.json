We come up every so often on HN as leaders in EUV optics manufacturing for ASML scanners. SMS is a branch of SMT concerned with standalone tooling for quality assurance and defect inspection in semiconductor fabs (tools like the AIMS EUV or PROVE systems, for example). We bring complete solutions to the hypercompetitive market that is the semiconductor industry. The scale is vast – the work you can be involved in ranges from simulations at the nanometer to how to ship tools via using Boeing 747(s).Software (and extremely diligent/precise engineering… honestly it blows my mind regularly) underpins everything we do and spans the same vastness of scale. We (Zeiss SMT, but also SMS where I work) are hiring in pretty much every IT field as we modernize systems, upgrade legacy code, and build cutting-edge new tools and platforms to remain at the front of the field. Specifically interesting to HN (I think) is my team, which works on developing extremely fast physics simulation and data processing code utilizing classical algorithms, machine learning, and _AI_, all on premise. We also build and maintain the hardware (HPC clusters) to enable these developments.Desirable skills\nPython (scientific, HPC, ML, physics simulation), image analysis (big, big data processing, very fast), CUDA, C++, HPC architecture design/on premise rack configuration, HPC admin, DevOps infrastructure (physical as well as CI/CD), GPGPU programming, FPGA programming, QA engineering, KubernetesI can post some job links tomorrow, but if you have questions please either comment or reach out to me at thomas dot pekin at zeiss dot com.

    "description": "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Infrastructure Software Engineer | Bay Area | Full-timeI currently run YC’s infrastructure and I need some help! Over the last 7 years I’ve been at YC, our software team has grown considerably both in engineers and in products. We need to invest more in our infrastructure so we can keep shipping our products quickly.The main thing you’ll need in this job is curiosity; I work at every layer of a very large stack. One day you might dig into AWS apis, another it’s a 3rd party Ruby gem or our git history. Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028511.The first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc).The main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you’ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you’ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform). You’re probably the person people turn to when there’s a fire to put out.YC has excellent compensation and benefits (see more in the formal job description: https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/0Ewh...). The team and the work life balance are great. About half of us are former founders and many of us are parents. And if you’re curious about startups (and possibly starting one someday), this job gives you amazing access to interact with YC’s programs, partners, and founders.If you’re interested, I’d love to chat!

We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.Healthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.What’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets.We’re changing that.At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)Our typical paid rate is above 95%.We are a team of 25 with STRONG product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.Email me at chris@juniperplatform.com",

We learn how your team works, identify “winning” strategies behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!We’re working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms & infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You'll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)Right now we’re a small team (~25 ppl) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $2.5M ARR!Looking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers. Excitement about language models, few-shot learning and other recent AI advances is also a plus :)I’d love to chat: reach me at nikhil [at] nooks.in or apply at the link below: https://nooks.breezy.hr/p/bbc06c1a1bb4-software-engineer",

Our technology lets first responders get eyes and ears on what's happening in indoor structures when it's too dangerous for people to enter - whether it be a fire, medical emergency, violence, or search and rescue. In March 2023, we released the Lemur 2, our latest and most advanced drone, and we started shipping it to customers the same year.In addition to launching more advanced drones, we're also expanding our software ecosystem into realtime monitoring and fleet management, and we recently shipped the first version of our first web app: LiveOps.  This app gives drone operators and first response teams access to real-time live-streaming drone data such as visual and thermal video feeds, 3D map data via point clouds, and a myriad of drone telemetry – it’s essentially a web-based drone fleet management software. But our vision isn’t just fleet management; LiveOps represents a critical part of BRINC’s transition from a company that just sells drones to a company that sells entire drone programs: we want to build out the entire drone ecosystem (both hardware and software) for our customers.It’s an ambitious goal, but it’s one that we feel confident about – we’ve got a lot of interest from customers in what we’ve built so far, and we are seeking both a full-stack and a backend/platform engineer to join our engineering team and own the development of this web app and cloud ecosystem.Job Postings:- Senior/Principal Full-stack Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f...- Senior/Principal Backend & Platform Engineer: https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5...Some recent press:- https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-wit...- https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/I'm the founding engineer for the cloud services engineering team at BRINC, so feel free to relay any questions about the role to me (dylan at brinc drones dot com, parse it yourself), but please apply through the job posting if you're interested in the role so that we can keep track of you!",

With louie.ai (generative AI), they can now talk with their many databases in natural language while having L.O.U.I.E. generate the queries, GPU visualizations, & analyses for them.We partner with companies like Nvidia & AWS to enable end-to-end GPU compute so operational teams can do all this at previously impossible scales and interactivity. Some projects folks may know us for include having donated the web tier of Apache Arrow used by performance-oriented data visualization frameworks, incubating what became Nvidia RAPIDS.AI, and our own server<>client GPU accelerated data visualization engine.We are looking for multiple candidates:- Visualization engineer - Scaling server/client GPU infovizWe are looking for a visualization engineer excited about enabling analysts to dig into bigger and trickier data. The near-term projects are around initiatives like increasing our visual scale another 100X (client GLSL <> server RAPIDS.ai GPU) and improving how analysts understand and collaborate (React, node, RAPIDS GPU). You’ll be working with our full-stack team, partners like Nvidia, and as we are a user-focused team, you’ll also have the chance to chat directly with analysts in our community channels and engage with their data teams. Over time, you’ll take ownership of increasing parts of the full stack GPU visualization pipeline and its direction. Global remote friendly, long-term (1yr+), and option of contract vs full-time (equity etc).\n- Security engineer - AI code sandbox hardeningWe’re looking for a security engineer (any time zone) to design, implement, test, and harden the AI code sandbox  louie.ai uses to secure untrusted code execution . You will collaborate with our architects and developers as we prepare the surrounding application for third-party security auditing and pen testing. You should have some familiarity with Linux and container security practices and tools such as libseccomp policies, strace, iptables, and container networking. Ideally you have worked on sandbox and jail breaking technology before from a attacker/defender side, and OS/network/container/VM isolation mechanisms in general. You must be _very_ comfortable with Python + Docker. This is a 2-4w initial project. Global/remote fine, with key meetings on PDT (US) time zones.\nMore info on these and other roles here: https://www.graphistry.com/careers",

    "description": "Paratus Ltd | REMOTE, occasional days ONSITE in London (UK) a plus | Full-timeParatus is a young company with a first-of-a-kind insurance product to protect businesses from price risk. Since our launch three years ago, we've demonstrated the viability of our model with a product protecting the shipping industry from changes in fuel price, and are now undergoing a large expansion into other sectors - particularly renewables and decarbonisation. Our new product for wind and solar farms protects them from falls in the price of electricity, and so makes investing in renewable power safer.I have been Paratus's CTO / sole full-time developer at Paratus for three years (working with specialist contractors as required for UX, security etc), but we're looking to increase the team size to four to support substantially increased demand and expansion of the company. Our initial role will be to support the sales team by maintaining and enhancing our pricing model, with a natural pivot into expanding our books-and-records system as sales pick up. In the medium term, there's the prospect of interesting new development work as increased capacity allows us to automate new parts of the business flow.Senior Developer - £100k+ (negotiable depending on experience/fit etc)The key thing we're looking for from our second developer hire is that they should be able to stand in for me in a pinch. Specifically:• You should be comfortable and familiar with the core of our tech stack (Java / Spring / PostgreSQL / AWS).• You should need be able to get up to speed quickly on an unfamiliar project and, after a short period of orientation, be able to self-teach / find your way around on your own.• A key requirement is that you should be able to cover for me if I become sick or unavailable - you should quickly reach the point where you can reliably carry out urgent development work unsupported.• A mathematical background would be a plus - our pricing model is somewhat technical and one of the key things we need to support.• As the team grows, you should be able to skill up quickly enough to be able to support and mentor less experienced developers who still need some help finding their way around.• Being able to assist with interview and recruitment processes would also be a plus.Developer - £60k-85k• You should have experience writing software as part of a team, using Git or other version control.• You should know how to write automated tests and understand why they are important.• You don't need to have the depth of experience necessary to become fully autonomous on day one, but once you understand a task and the area of the codebase you're changing, you should be capable of working reliably and independently.Please email a CV / cover letter to careers@paratusltd.com to apply.",

    "description": "Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer\nIn the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.Open positions include:* Staff and Senior Health Data Engineer* Senior Software Engineer - Program Development Kit Engine* Staff Software Engineer, Data Serving* Staff Software Engineer, Production ApplicationsJobs Board: https://bit.ly/nuna-job-boardFrontend: React, TypescriptBackend: Django, Python, ScalaCloud: AWSQuestions?
