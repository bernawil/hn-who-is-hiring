These SDKs are world-class: you get an idiomatic wrapper with autocomplete, types, etc. (I built a version of this at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)Next, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right. We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.From there, we plan to build out a rich family of developer platform products – everything an API team would need to deliver a terrific DX to their partners and/or customers.We’re about 1.5y old, under 5 people, have strong revenue, and are selling to companies you interact with every day.

Permanent or co-founder roles may be available in the future.Detailed version:We're a vendor of data monitoring and automation technology for small-to-medium sized agriculturalists - mostly growers of wine grapes, fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, etc. Our predecessor companies (which go back as early as 1982) have supplied technology to some of the world's leading food and wine producers, research institutions and agri-business brands.Our main products are:- A data monitor that reads soil moisture and other environmental metrics, and uploads data to the cloud via Cat-M1, and a partner web app that displays data on maps+graphs and manages the devices.- A webapp that displays data from a network of 70+ weather stations across some major growing regions of Australia, and displays weather data updated every 10 minutes and long-term historical graphsWe're looking for people with the following skills:- Electronics engineering - designing circuits and circuit boards for IoT data monitoring/control applications, using Nordic SiP/SoC devices or comparable components. Experience with contemporary cellular data networks (Cat M1, NB-IoT) very welcome, as well as other radio data technologies, e.g., LoraWAN, DigiMesh, ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi.- Programming for above hardware platforms, ideally very experienced with C and the Zephyr platform. Knowledge of Mororola/Freescale assembly language a big advantage, for the purpose of porting functionality from a legacy device.This would be particularly interesting to someone who wants to go deep developing a new hardware/firmware architecture for this industry; something like what Cisco IOS is to networking, but for agriculture data monitoring/control. We’re also considering offering the circuit board as a barebones/OEM product, a-la “Raspberry Pi for agriculture”, so it would be a great opportunity for someone who want to be a part of that.We’re a new, “clean slate” company being established by people with decades of industry/product experience and solid relationships and reputation. We have several significant sales opportunities waiting to be fulfilled. And as a newly founded company we can offer substantial “ground-floor” equity allocations to the right people.For more info, contact: tom+jobs at taindata.com.",

We're building this as the next inevitable layer in the AI stack, a way to get to per-user training and per-user accuracy.In less technical speak, we're building AGI from the bottom-up using an alternative to backpropagation, starting from the simplest animal levels. In business speak, we have an AI Agents-as-a-Service API to enable per-user accuracy and training.Fundraising the past 6 months for anything in AI that's not genAI was difficult. Still, nobody can do what we can in AI. Not even close. Maybe we're a research project for a while longer, however we're especially looking for business-minded people to help us move forward.",

    "description": "Oso | Engineering Manager | New York City (NYC) | Onsite/HybridCompanies like AWS, Stripe, and Twilio have demonstrated that if a technology is not core to your value proposition, you should offload it. Still, every engineering team builds and rebuilds one piece: *authorization*, how you control who has access to what in your app. You’ve probably started with something quick 'n dirty – some IF statements and roles in a database...until you need to add more features, and more features. And inevitably you band-aid onto this system until you have to do a big refactor. Have you seen this before?We're changing this picture and in doing so, we are creating the next $25B+ dollar market: the authorization market. We’re on a mission to create the global standard for authorization. Our vision is that in 10 years engineers will spend 1/10 the time and brainpower they spend on authorization today.This is a once-in-a-career opportunity to join a company at a stage late enough that the problem and solution are de-risked, but early enough that you can shape the product, company, and the market.We are based in NYC and hiring folks onsite/hybrid.To apply, please visit: https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/Oso/043fb953-d2b9-4bbe-8640-497272c...For more info, visit: https://www.osohq.com/company/jobs",
